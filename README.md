# SMU_June2021_Bootcamp_Homework

This Folder contains most of the assignments that were required in my Data Science bootcamp. This repo does not include projects that were required as well as two assignments that will be in the Websites Folder. I will list and explain each assignment below with the relative skills that were used and learned. 

## 01-Excel
The requirements for this assignment were to apply conditional formatting and create pivot tables to create categories in a dataset of past Kickstarter projects to make it easier to further analysis. The completed assignment and analysis of the data can be found here https://github.com/stevengreen320/SMU_June2021_Bootcamp_Homework/tree/main/01-Excel/Submissions 

## 02-VBA-Scripting
The goal of this assignment was to use VBA to analyze stock market data from a dataset. Requirements were to find each stock symbol, calculate the yearly change from beginning to end, calculating the percentage change of that stock and the total volume of that stock. Also, the goal was to write a summary of the analyzed data. The completed assignment and analysis of the data can be found here https://github.com/stevengreen320/SMU_June2021_Bootcamp_Homework/tree/main/02-VBA-Scripting/Submissions 

## 03-Python
The goal of this assignment was to write a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company and the results of an election from given datasets, PyBank and PyPoll

PyBank
