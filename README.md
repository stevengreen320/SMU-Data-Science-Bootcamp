# SMU_June2021_Bootcamp_Homework

This Folder contains most of the assignments that were required in my Data Science bootcamp. This repo does not include projects that were required as well as two assignments that will be in the Websites Folder. I will list and explain each assignment below with the relative skills that were used and learned. 

## 01-Excel
The requirements for this assignment was to apply conditional formatting and create pivot tables to create categories in a dataset of past Kickstarter projects to make it easier to further analysis. The completed assignment and analysis of the data is located in the submissions section of the folder.
